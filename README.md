# languageAsData
This course introduces  the characteristics of language data and the associated challenges for representation learning. Natural language is a powerful and creative means of communication: it follows rules only to make exceptions, and it evolves over time and from domain to domain. Language signals are highly ambiguous and the formâ€”meaning mapping can only be interpreted in context. In this course, we acquired the conceptual knowledge to analyze structure in language data and understand the methodological assumptions underlying representation learning in large language models.

The course consists of three parts: 
1) Analyzing Language:  introducing the characteristics of language as a signal 
2) Modeling Language: introducing the foundations of language modeling
3) Using Language Models: introducing techniques for applying LLMs for transfer (e.g. finetuning, prompting, adapting, etc).
