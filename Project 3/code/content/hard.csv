Not bad at all.;1
It could have been better.;0
An interesting mix of good and bad moments.;1
The film tries hard but ultimately fails.;0
Leaves the audience wanting more.;1
Some scenes are great, others fall flat. ;0
The acting was fine, but the plot was dull. ;0
Not a movie Iâ€™d recommend.;0
Better than most, but still not great. ;0
I have mixed feelings about it. ;0
